# CppPythonIntergration
using Python32-bit with c++

This was a little bit of a pain to get running. I believe everyones computer may display some thing slightly different, 
however if you have 32 bit python version installed the .exe file should run as intended. This program demonstrate how 
c++ can help boost performance towards python to move through data at a faster rate of speed.
